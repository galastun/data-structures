# Linked List

Linked lists are similar to array but have some advantages over them. In a lot of languages, array length is fixed. Inserting and deleting is much easier in a linked list versus an array. It is expensive to add to an array because space must be made for the new element. Removing is also expensive because if you remove something from the middle of the array, you must shift everything after it to the left.

One of the main drawbacks of a linked list is you can't access an element directly like you can in an array. You must go through all nodes until you find what you're looking for. Array elements also have better cache locality which impacts performance.
